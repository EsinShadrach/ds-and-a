## Big O Notation

### What is “BIG O”

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on the input.
It generalizes the growth of your algorithms
It describes how your algorithm reacts as your input(s) grows
Therefore O(n) => algorithm would grow linearly based on n input
// As your input grows, how fast does your memory or computation grow?

### Why should you use “BIG O”

It helps in making decisions on which algorithms/Data structures to use

### Things to note about “BIG O”

1. Growth is respective to input refer to [sum-to-chars](./sum-char-codes.ts)

### How to tell? Look for loops
